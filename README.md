# Getting and Cleaning Data - Course project


* This is the course project for the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course.
* The included R script, `run_analysis.R`, conducts the following:


1. Download the dataset from web if it does not already exist in the working directory.
2. Read data from files into the variables of interest.
3. Merges the training and the test sets to create one dataset.
4. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
5. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the dataset
6. Appropriately labels the dataset with descriptive variable names.
7. Creates a second, independent tidy dataset with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
8. The result is shown in the file 'Tidy_Dataset.txt'
